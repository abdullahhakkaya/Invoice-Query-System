## Code Structure

- `Program` class: Contains the `Main` method, displays menu, and processes user input.
- `Invoice` class: Represents an invoice item with properties for part number, description, quantity, and price.
- LINQ queries are used to filter, sort, and project invoice data.

## Error Handling

The application uses a try-catch block to handle unexpected runtime exceptions gracefully, displaying error messages and preventing crashes.
